‚òÄÔ∏è UrjaLink - Solar Energy Marketplace
UrjaLink is a modern, full-stack web application that provides a platform for the peer-to-peer trading of solar energy. It features a clean, responsive user interface and a robust backend to handle user authentication, energy listings, and transaction histories.

This project serves as the foundational centralized version, with plans to evolve into a fully decentralized application (DApp) on the blockchain.
